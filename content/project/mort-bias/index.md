### The impact of biological mortality bias in growth on bioarchaeological interpretations of past populations

Goal: The purpose of this project is to reflect on the likely magnitude of mortality bias in growth in the past. Are archaeological skeletal samples of juveniles representative of their living peers? Is this representativeness or lack thereof even across populations? Within a population, is the bias stable across age groups and between the sexes?

Data for this study include: skeletal and dental development data from CT scans of children from two sites, one in the US and one in Australia; full body cadaveric measurements from a medicolegal institution in the US; and historical records from a Portuguese tuberculosis sanatorium.

### Project status

This project comprised Laure Spake's doctoral research. Empirical findings from the dissertation have been published, but I am continuing to think about these topics and how to quantify mortality bias in new and innovative ways.


### Funding information

This project was supported by grants from Mitacs Canada (Globalink IT13950) awarded to Laure Spake, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC RGPIN-201-05863) awarded to Hugo Cardoso, and the Department of Archaeology at Simon Fraser University awarded to Laure Spake.
