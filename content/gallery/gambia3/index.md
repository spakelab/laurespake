Our team conducted interviews with over 700 women across the West Kiang region. The team often meets participants in their gardens to work around their schedules. In this image, we are recruiting participants and scheduling times to visit them to conduct interviews. This photo was taken in West Kiang, the Gambia, during data collection for the [Evolutionary Demography of Religion Project](https://www.evolutionarydemographyofreligion.org/).
