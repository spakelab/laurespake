After the initial wave of data collection for the [Evolutionary Demography of Religion Project](https://www.evolutionarydemographyofreligion.org/), we held community meetings to share some of the early results of our project. In this image, field team members (Abubacarr, Jonsaba, and Matarr) work with Laure and John to share key findings with the alkalo (chief) and key residents in Keneba. Over the course of 10 days, we organized and held meetings with representatives of all 23 villages in which we collected data.
