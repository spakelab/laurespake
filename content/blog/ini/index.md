## About me 

I am a medical doctor and public health student who is passionate about womenâ€™s health, maternal and child health, health literacy, health education, and public health messaging. My current research in the lab focuses on identifying the effect of social support on child upbringing and child health. I have been working on qualitative data analysis of focus group discussions held in The Gambia and the USA to identify what sources of information mothers value when making decisions about their children. Outside the lab, I am also looking to identify the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on sources of health information across different populations.

In the future, I see myself working in fields that align health information and policy formations.

I enjoy visiting new places and learning about different cultures - but not necessarily the journey. When I am outside the lab, I am either sewing, trying to learn a new recipe, or searching for the next place to visit!

Here is a picture of me from my recent trip in an outfit I made.
