## My work 

I work on the following topics:

+ Biological mortality bias in growth (bioarchaeology)
+ Methods for estimating the biological profile (forensic anthropology, bioarchaeology)
+ Alloparenting and its impacts on child outcomes (evolutionary anthropology, biological anthropology)
+ Inter-and intra-population variation in growth (biological anthropology, bioarchaeology)

I enjoy integrating computational methods in my work and am always seeking to learn new data science methods. 

I have collected data in Australia, across Europe, the US and in The Gambia.

## Outside of work

I am a big fan of the outdoors, and love spending time with Oreo, my cuddly black lab. Here's a picture of her enjoying a walk on our way to a conference in California.
