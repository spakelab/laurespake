## About me 

I have a Masterâ€™s in Biological Anthropology and have a wide breadth of research experience ranging from the paleontology of carnivores in the eocene from Wyoming Great Horn Basin,  bio-cultural research of MMORPGers, and primate comparative anatomy from the pelvis to the inner ear. Currently, my dissertation is focused on *Homo sapiens* mandibular growth and development as it relates to weaning and applications toward studying children in other species of the genus Homo. 

In the Spake lab, I use a variety of statistical analyses on human skeletal differences and pathologies.

In the summer I spend my time working at Neandertal field sites in Atapuerca, Spain and Saint-Cesaire, France. And in my free time I enjoy reading the worst fiction books known to man, playing music with my guitar, and playing video games.
