## About me 

As a forensic anthropologist from Colombia, I have experience supporting investigative processes related to the location, recovery, analysis, and identification of victims in the context of armed conflict and criminal cases. In addition, I have actively contributed to humanitarian forensic initiatives in response to mass casualty events and provided international technical assistance in forensic interventions in natural disasters. 

As a PhD student, I am interested in further developing methodological approaches to the analysis of gunshot trauma to improve their utility for forensic science and criminal justice practitioners. In the Spake Lab, I have been working on the implementation of CT scan imaging for gunshot wound analysis in bones.
